# dbt-postgres Project

## Overview
This project leverages **dbt (Data Build Tool)** with **PostgreSQL** to streamline the process of transforming raw data into valuable insights. The project utilizes dbt models to perform data transformations within the PostgreSQL database, helping to build a robust data pipeline that is easy to maintain and scale.

## Features
- Data transformation using dbt models
- PostgreSQL as the target data warehouse
- Includes SQL-based transformations, snapshots, and tests
- Automated data quality checks through dbt's testing capabilities
- Integration with other data tools for ETL processes

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)
- Python (for installing dbt and its dependencies)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dbt-postgres.git
   cd dbt-postgres
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install dbt-postgres:
   ```bash
   pip install dbt-postgres
   ```

5. Set up your dbt profile by editing the `profiles.yml` file located in `~/.dbt/` (create the file if it does not exist). The file should include the connection details for your PostgreSQL database:
   ```yaml
   dbt_postgres:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: postgres
         host: your_host
         user: your_user
         password: your_password
         dbname: your_dbname
         schema: your_schema
         threads: 1
   ```

## Usage

1. To run your dbt project, simply execute:
   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```

2. To test your transformations, run:
   ```bash
   dbt test
   ```

3. To build the documentation for the project:
   ```bash
   dbt docs generate
   ```

4. To serve the generated documentation locally:
   ```bash
   dbt docs serve
   ```

## Project Structure
- **models/**: Contains dbt models for transforming raw data into useful outputs.
- **macros/**: Custom macros used in your dbt models.
- **seeds/**: Static data files that can be loaded into the database.
- **snapshots/**: For capturing and tracking changes over time.
- **tests/**: Contains tests to validate your data models.
- **dbt_project.yml**: The configuration file for your dbt project.
